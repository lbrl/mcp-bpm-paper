\section{Introduction}

The J-PARC muon $g-2$/EDM experiment \cite{E34} aims to measure the muon anomalous magnetic moment ($g-2$) and the muon electric dipole moment (EDM) with high precision.
A new beam line for muons (H-line)~\cite{h-line} is under development.
The J-PARC $g-2$/EDM experiment requires a muon beam with small transverse emittance that is obtained by re-accelerating ultra-slow muon. %based on so-called ``ultra-slow muon'' acceleration.
The ultra slow muon is produced from ionization of muonium at thermal energy with laser.
Muonium is produced by stopping surface muon beam in a muonium production target~\cite{muonium}.  
This muon beam with low transverse momentum will be re-accelerated to \SI{300}{\MeV\per\clight} \cite{IH} while minimizing the increase of the transverse momentum ($\sigma_{pT}/p~=~10^{-5}$).
The accelerated muon beam is injected to the storage area under \SI{3}{\tesla} field without electric focusing~\cite{injection}. The measurements of $g-2$ with a precision of \SI{0.1}{\ppm} and the EDM with a sensitivity to \SI{e-21}{\elementarycharge \cdot \cm}.  A proper beam diagnostics is required for the development of this new technique. \\
Different from other surface muon monitors~\cite{muon_bpm1}, the BPM is designed to measure a beam profile and relative intensity for each bunch simultaneously from low intensity (a few muons per bunch) to high intensity in the energy range from a few \SI{}{\keV} to \SI{4}{\MeV}.
A BPM based on Micro-Channel Plate (MCP) has been developed to obtain necessary gain and efficiency to measure a low \textcolor{red}{intensity} beam.
There have been several experiments that have used detectors based on MCP assembly to work with muons, neutrons, ions, atoms and positronium~\cite{muon_bpm2, neutron, Ps} beam.
%but no concrete study has been carried out for the muon beam profile.
Distinct from other beams, muons stopped in the MCP by short penetration depth are decayed to positrons in the MCP and these positrons can give signals in the BPM via penetration of the MCP channels. 
Understanding and subtracting this positron background from the muon signal are one of challenges to measure precise beam profile. %with negligible fraction of the background.  \\
In this paper, we present the results of tests using the surface muon beam and the UV light source.
The responses of muon and positron signal response %is studied and 
, the linearity% for dynamic range from a few to $10^{4}$ muon per bunch is 
were measured by surface muon beam.
%Furthermore, the decay positron time distribution has been obtained by surface muon beam at the J-PARC D-2 beam line~\cite{D-line, D-line1}.  
The spatial resolution was measured by a UV light with a half-circle hole collimator.


\section{BPM design and specification}

As a beam profile monitor at the first stage of ultra-cold muon re-acceleration, the BPM is designed to diagnose a muon beam with %\SI{\sim 100}{\micro\metre} 
sub-milimeter resolution for $\sim$\SI{10}{mm} beam spot size for the energy range from a few to \SI{4}{\MeV} that is the low $\beta$ section of the muon LINAC \cite{IH}.
The BPM aims to measure a muon intensity from a few muons to \num{e5} muons per bunch at a repetition rate of \SI{25}{\hertz}. % frequency.
As shown in Fig.\ref{fig:BPM_scheme}, the BPM consists of two stage of MCP, one stage of phosphor screen and a CCD camera.
% as an widely used detector assembly in the beam diagnosis. %especially electron, atomic and molecule beam experiments.~\cite{}
High efficiency for \si{\keV} order atomic and ion beams has been observed in several experiments\cite{MCP_efficiency, MCP_efficiency1}. Similar high efficiency for a low energy muon beam is expected.

\end{center} \end{figure}

The MCP assembly (HAMAMATSU, F2225-21P) has two stages of chevron type MCP with an effective area of $\varphi=\SI{40}{\mm}$ and a gain of $10^{6\sim7}$ and a phosphor screen (P47). The light output from the phosphor screen has been transmitted through a glass viewport (7056 Borosiliate) and then captured by the cooled CCD camera (PCO, PCO1600 : 800 $\times$ 600 pixels for 2$\times$2 binning mode) with the lens (ZEISS, Distagon 2/28 ZF.2). 
In order to block the electron background, negative potential (\SI{-1.9}{\kilo\volt}) is applied in the MCP front surface (MCP IN).
The MCP back surface (MCP OUT) is connected to a ground after an electric circuit to read out the electric signal of the MCP which is required to check the beam arrival time.
Positive potential (\SI{3.9}{\kilo\volt}) is applied to the phosphor screen (Phosphor IN).
An exposure time of the CCD camera is set to \SI{500}{\nano\s} to reject the positron from the muon decay ($\tau$ = \SI{2.2}{\micro\s}).
The P47 phosphor material with a short decay time ($\tau_{\SI{10}{\percent}}=\SI{0.11}{\micro\s}$) compared to the exposure time has been used for this discrimination method.

\section{Experiment with muon beam}

\subsection{Experimental setup} 

The experimental setup for the surface muon beam test is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:simulation} {(top)} and as schematic view in Fig.\ref{fig:simulation} {(bottom)}.
J-PARC facility sends surface muons ($\mu^{+}$) as pulsed beam to the MLF D2 area with \SI{100}{\nano\s} beam width, kinetic energy with \textcolor{red}{\SI{4}{\MeV}} and \SI{25}{\hertz} repetition rate~\cite{D-line, D-line1}.
The beam intensity is adjusted by slits in the beamline.
The beam size and intensity was adjusted by one of lead collimators with $\varphi=\SI{10}{\mm}$, $\SI{20}{\mm}$ and $\SI{40}{\mm}$ hole installed between the exit window of the beam line and the BPM vacuum chamber.
The MCP assembly has been installed inside of the BPM vacuum chamber which is separated from the beam line as an independent vacuum system.

Number of muon on the BPM was measured from decay positrons.
Some fraction of the decay positrons from muons stopped in the MCP volume go through the mylar film in the left window of the BPM chamber and give signals to the positron counter. 
The positron counter consists of two plastic scintillators with corresponding light guides and PMTs. %($ch1, ch2, ch3$).
The positron counter is shielded by lead blocks from the muon beam line and the BPM vacuum chamber. This will block the decay positron from other materials and a $\varphi=\SI{30}{\mm}$ hole opened in the collimator allows positrons only coming from the MCP.
The signal above threshold with width narrower than 30ns is selected from positron counter to reject electric noise. 
The coincidence condition between two positron counters within \SI{30}{\ns} time range is selected for decay positron from MCP region only without other background.
%A muon beam size can be larger than the effective area of the MCP by beam emittance and scattering in for large collimator hole setup.
%So some of the muon are stopped not at the MCP but at other obstacles and positrons from these muons can give signal to the positron counter. 
%Because this effect can give a bias to estimate a muon number in BPM by the positron counter, 
%The beam acceptance at the MCP with several collimator\textcolor{red}{hole sizes} %, mylar film, etc 
%is checked by the simulation.
%Also an origin of the decay positron measured in the positron counter which come from a muon stopped at the MCP or other obstacles is checked to get a correction factor for \textcolor{red}{an estimated} muon intensity from the positron counter.

\vspace{-0.4cm}
\label{fig:simulation}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Data taking} 
Data from the BPM have been taken as 2-D pictures by the CCD camera with \SI{500}{\nano\s} exposure time.
The arrival time of the muon beam has been checked by an electric signal from the MCP for proper exposure timing. At the same time, the data from the positron counter has been digitized with $\SI{10}{\micro\s}$ time window in coincidence with the muon beam pulse.

To obtain beam profile and intensity from a few muons per beam bunch, MCP signal from a single muon should have an enough gain and a sharp signal shape to overcome the CCD camera noise.
To understand the property of single muon signal, data with a few muons per pulse have been taken. Then, data with several different intensities have been taken by changing the size of the slit in the beam line and collimator. To understand positron signals in the BPM, data were taken with different trigger timing for CCD camera as well. These pictures, especially with a few to several \si{\micro\s} delayed trigger timing from muon beam arrival, are taken with low intensity to high intensity.
The typical CCD image taken at different intensities are displayed in Fig.3. The high intensity muon beam image as a raw picture (top right) and accumulation of 1000 pictures in colored histogram (top left). Low intensity muon beam raw picture is shown in (bottom left) and low intensity positron data with $\SI{2}{\micro\s}$ delayed trigger timing is shown in (bottom right).

	\vspace{-0.4cm}
	\label{fig:single_cluster}
\end{figure}
%Even though short exposure time is used to reduce positron background, positron background is still expected in muon beam picture and this background effect is needed to be understand. 
\subsection{Data analysis}


As shown in Fig.3 (bottom left), the muon signals are distinguishable from the CCD noise by a high gain and the signal shape is a two dimensional sharp Gaussian distribution with additional broad tail distribution. 
To analyze the signals from CCD noise, a cluster is defined for single signal selection. A single cluster region for each signal is defined as $9\times9$ pixels from the pixel with maximum ADC count in each signal. This region is about 5 times of root mean square(RMS) width (1.6 pixel) of a single muon signal. The scale of a pixel in the picture is calculated considering the MCP active area size (\SI{0.08}{\mm \per \pixel}).
Each cluster is identified by detecting 3$\times$3 pixels with ADC counts above some thresholds considering the standard deviation of the CCD noise fluctuation (\SI{8.7}{ADC}). The properties of single clusters are studied with this selection criteria.
%The cluster is selected from the highest ADC count while the ADC count of a pixel is above $3~\times~\sigma_{ccd}$.
%If at least 1 pixel, among 8 pixels around the maximum height pixel of a signal, has ADC count less than $1\times\sigma_{ccd}$, this signal is regarded as a CCD noise. 
%A standard deviation $\sigma_{ccd}$ of the CCD noise for each pixel are measured without beam and the value \num{8.7 \pm 0.4} ADC count is much less than the muon signal height. The properties of single clusters are studied with this selection criteria.

The distribution of the cluster ADC sum is displayed in Fig.\ref{fig:BPM_int}.
The ADC sum distribution shows a an isolated peak for exposure on muon pulse and a peakless decrease for delayed exposure (t$_{delay}$={2}, \SI{3}{\micro\s}).

\begin{figure}[tb]
	\begin{minipage}[t]{60mm}
		\includegraphics[width=1.30\textwidth, height=1.1\textwidth]{figure/Integ_legend_v2.pdf} %Figure4_integral_run6_7_11_9by9_sum.png}
	\end{minipage}
	\caption{Cluster ADC sum in $9\times9$ pixels for the exposure on muon pulse (solid) and the delayed exposure (dashed).
		Normalization is done for positron histogram by matching with muon histogram}
	\vspace{-0.2cm}
	\label{fig:BPM_int}
\end{figure}

A positron signal can have an elliptic shape or even several bumps over the signal region by penetrating the MCP, because decay positrons are generated inside the MCP with arbitrary directions.
To parametrize the signal width, the minimum RMS width and the maximum RMS width of the clusters are calculated along the axes of the ellipse. The maximum width distribution is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:positron_width}.

For the muon beam coincided data, the maximum width distribution is almost the same with the minimum width distribution except a small tale in maximum width distribution. This is because the incident muon has mainly longitudinal momentum and makes symmetric signal.
For the delayed exposure data (t$_{delay}$={2}, \SI{3}{\micro\s}), minimum width distribution is similar to that of the muon signal but maximum width distribution shows much more events with large RMS value. Under the maximum RMS width cut ($\Gamma_{max}~<~$\SI{0.15}{\mm}), \SI{57}{\percent} of the clusters in delayed exposure data survive while \SI{94}{\percent} of the clusters in muon beam coincided data survive.
%the $56.8\pm0.3\%$ of positron clusters survives while $94.1\pm0.2\%$ of clusters from muon beam data survives.

	\caption{Signal's maximum RMS width histogram for the exposure on muon pulse (solid) and the delayed exposure (dashed) after rotating axes.}
	\label{fig:positron_width}
\end{figure}
%All muons which hit the MCP stop in the MCP volume. They decay into positrons and these positrons can give signals to the BPM. 
The time distribution of the decay positron is exponential decay function smeared by the time distribution of the muon beam. In order to check this distribution, the BPM data are taken by changing the trigger timing from $\SI{-0.5}{\micro\s}$ to $\SI{10}{\micro\s}$ with high intensity muon beam. The total ADC sum distribution versus the trigger time is shown in Fig.6.

For $\SI{500}{\nano\s}$ exposure the center of which is coincided with the muon beam arrival, $\SI{11}{\percent}$ of the stopped muon is expected to decay to the positron. The contribution of the decay positrons to the BPM signal is deduced from the total ADC sum distribution. The exponential function is fitted to the data in the time region later than $\SI{2}{\micro\s}$, in order to avoid the contributions of incident muons. The measured decay parameter $\tau_{\mu}=\SI{2.12 \pm 0.09}{\micro\s}$ is agreed with muon life time. The fraction of the positron contribution to the total ADC sum, $\varepsilon$, is $\SI{2.51\pm0.17}{\percent}$.

The number of muons reaching the BPM has been estimated from the total ADC sum. The necessary calibration has been obtained from the analysis of low intensity muon beam data where the response of each individual particle is identified. The average ADC count generated by single cluster, $a$, is obtained by dividing the total ADC count by the number of detected clusters in the CCD image.
\begin{figure}[bt]
	\begin{minipage}[t]{60mm}

	\end{minipage}
	\caption{The time distribution of BPM signal intensity with different triggertime. An exponetial function is fitted from 2000ns to 10000ns and extrapolation to 0ns is shown.}
	\label{fig:time_distribution}
\end{figure}

The parameter $a$ from the data coincided with muon beam arrival is inadequate to be used for the estimation of number of muons because it contains the contributions of both muons and positrons. On the other hand, the data taken with enough delay from the muon beam contain mostly contributions from the positrons. By applying cluster analysis to this data, the average ADC count generated by single cluster from positron, $a_e$, is obtained. The $a_e$ value, together with the measured ADC fraction of positron signal, $\varepsilon$, is used to estimated the $a_\mu$, the average of total ADC counts generated by single cluster of muon. The measured total ADC sum is converted to the number of muons with these calibration constants.

For general data at various muon beam current taken in coincidence with the arrival of the beam, the total ADC sum in each picture, $A$, is measured. With the parameter $a$, the number of total clusters is calculated as $A/a$, even when the single cluster is not able to be distinguished due to the high muon beam current.
Out of $A$, $\varepsilon A$ is considered as the contribution from the positrons. Thus, the number of clusters generated by the positrons is estimated as $\varepsilon A/a_e$. Then, the rest of clusters are considered to be generated by muons. The number of muon clusters is calculated with this reasoning.
% finally, the average intensity, $a_\mu$, generated by single cluster from muons can be obtained as follows.

It is safely assumed that one muon generates only one cluster since the transverse momentum of muon is sufficiently limited by the upstream collimator. Therefore, the calculated number of muon clusters is taken as the number of incident muons detected by the BPM.

An another independent estimation of the number of muons is made from the number of positrons detected by the scintillators located next to the BPM chamber. The proportionality constant has been obtained from the simulation based on the actual experimental setup which is implemented in GEANT4 library\cite{geant4}. 
The simulation estimates the number of muons on the MCP from the number of positrons detected by the positron counter in coincidence with muons.

\caption{Estimated muon number from BPM vs estimated muon number from positron counter.Bottom graph shows residual distribution divided by error.}

	\label{fig:muvsmu}
\end{figure}

The comparison of the number of muons obtained by these two independent methods at various values of the muon beam current is displayed on Fig.7. The detected muon beam intensity ranges from a few muon to $10^{4}$ muon per bunch with three different size of the collimator holes and several settings of slit in the beam line.

The statistical and systematic uncertianties are considered in the error bars. The major systematic uncertainties are from spatial gain difference ($\sim$4.4\%), trigger timing uncertainty ($\sim$3.8\%), positron background fitting ($\sim$5.6\%) and inside light reflection ($\sim$2.4\%). The statistical uncertainty is ten times smaller than systematic uncertainties except for the small positron counts in low intensity beam where the statistical error is about 10\% for N$_\mu$ ($e^+$ counter). The total error is calculated as a square root of the square sum for all contributions and it ranges from 9.6\% to 11.2\% for N$_\mu$ (BPM) and 1.7\% to 11.7\% for N$_\mu$ ($e^+$ counter).

A first order polynomial function is fitted for the whole dataset and the slope is \num{1.01\pm 0.03} with $\chi^{2}$ value of 0.87/ndf. No clear evidence of the saturation is detected and almost all measurements agreed well with fitting function within 2$\sigma$.  

\section{Spatial resolution}
 
The expected muon beam spot size at first stages of muon re-acceleration is a few millimeters.
To check consistency with this requirements, the sharp-edge pictures were taken with a collimator and UV light source to measure the BPM spatial resolution.
UV light usage allows one to avoid the positron background inevitably related to muons.

The half-circle open \SI{.5}{\cm} stainless collimator was placed in \SI{1}{\cm} from the MCP front surface
such as the collimator's edge was near the MCP center.
%\textcolor{red}{\SI{0}{\nm}} photons provided by
UV light provided by the Xe-lamp source were guided by a light fibre to the vacuum chamber.
The light guide output is centered with the main MCP and collimator axis
with distance along this axis about \SI{15}{\cm}.
Thus the collimator cast a sharp shadow on the MCP,
the illuminated plate part gave a signal to be analyzed for spatial resolution measurement.

The set of pictures taken with the same CCD camera and MCP assembly condition as during the test at the D2 beam line was averaged.
The collimator edge image was aligned to pixel rows by picture rotation and 
one pixel thick vertical slices were obtained (see Fig.~\ref{fig:half_circle}).
Discrete differentiation was applied to each slice  and the peak,
which corresponds to the collimator edge is,
was emphasized by Hann function multiplication.
The modulation transfer function was evaluated by the fast Fourier transformation and
the \SI{10}{\percent} height frequency $\nu_{\SI{10}{\percent}}$ was obtained using polynomial approximation to additionally suppress statistic fluctuations.
More detailed information on the UV light resolution study can be found in \cite{Gosha}.
$\nu_{\SI{10}{\percent}}$ corresponds to $\Delta_\gamma = \SI{294(12)}{\um}$,
which should be considered as an upper limit,
because of light reflection from the edge's surface induced by collimator and UV fiber misalignment.

\end{figure}

To estimate the spatial resolution in case of a muon beam single peak widths of muons and UV photons were studied.
The average of their mean widths is equal to
$\sigma_{\mu} / \sigma_{\gamma} = \num{1.04 \pm 0.10}$
and therefore the upper limit for spatial resolution of the BPM in muon case is
$\Delta_\mu = \SI{306(31)}{\um}$.
The profile monitor satisfies the accelerator requirements.


\section{Conclusion}

A BPM has been developed to diagnose the ultra-cold muon beam line at the J-PARC muon $g-2$/EDM experiment. The BPM has been tested and evaluated by a surface muon beam and a UV light source.
It has been possible to observe spatial distribution of beam particles with this BPM.
A high signal to noise ratio between muon signals and positron background is achieved and the positron background rate has been reduced to a negligible level with the adequate selection criteria and short exposure window for CCD camera.
The BPM shows a good linearity without noticeable saturation for the full capacity from a few muons to \num{e4} muons. The spatial resolution less than \SI{294\pm12}{\micro\metre} has been deduced from the UV light data.
%All test is well agreed with designed BPM requirements.

%This study can be a good reference for a low energy and low intensity beam diagnostics like anti-proton or positron beam which is well developed recently.
%The anti-proton or positron beams decay or annihilate to detectable daughter particles in beam profile monitor and our BPM study would be helpful to understand signal in the detector.
